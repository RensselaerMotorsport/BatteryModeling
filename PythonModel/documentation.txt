Goals for Spring 2024:
    Develop a steady-state python model for battery cell heating
    Add functionality for a segment of cells
    Accurate model with for a cell level fuse

    let user put in battery info
        Max, min, nominal cell voltage
        nominal internal resistance
        max current
    Let user put in environment parameters
        ambient temp
        current draw from load
        etc.
    get data out from sim:
        battery temp
        internal resistance
        etc.
    Do this for all conductors eventually
        bus bars
        wires
        fuses


Inputs for our model:
- Cell type
- max, min, nominal cell voltage
- nominal internal resistance
- max current
- ambient temp
- current draw from load

Outputs from our model:
- battery temp
- internal resistance


Our model runs on the PyBaMM python API.
